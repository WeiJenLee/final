Seems that I have successfully implemented Sweep/Optimize/Strash/Simulation.
Now only fraig left. I have to find out how to use SAT engine first lol.

Hey guys,

I successfully implemented all the function.
You can just git pull from master to find the latest code.
Part of code still need improvement,
my efficiency is large behind ref program.

In function "CIRSImulate" and "CIRFraig", there should be a better algorithm to find every FEC pair.
If every has any idea, please share with me.
