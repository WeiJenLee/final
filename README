Seems that I have successfully implemented Sweep/Optimize/Strash/Simulation.
Now only fraig left. I have to find out how to use SAT engine first lol.
If you have any idea, please share it with me.

Hey guys,

I successfully implemented all the function.
You can just git pull from master to find the latest code.
Part of code still need improvement,
my efficiency is large behind ref program.

In function "CIRSImulate" and "CIRFraig", there should be a better algorithm to find every FEC pair.
If every has any idea, please share with me.

Hey guys,

I have finished my final project. All the function are correctly(?) implemented.

However, my running time is longer than proffesor's ref profram, especially in function simulated. If you are interested in improving this program, feel free to pull my program and make some modification.
